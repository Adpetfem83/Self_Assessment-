# Self_Assessment-

First and foremost, I am really happy and elated that I was to withstand the rigor and intensiveness of the program, in spite of many challenges I had right from the beginning and up to the near end of this great program. Some of the challenges I had initially ranged from being a new beginner and a novice when it comes to programming languages, health challenges and also the emotional trauma from the health challenges and other personal issues. I knew, I did not come to the program with the right frame of mind due to all these issues. At some points in this program, I felt like I should drop and join the the next badge that just started in November. However, glory be to Almighty God who gave me the opportunity to survive some of the challenges and I am here today giving the great testimonies.

In terms of the program, it was a rigorous and a highly intensive one. I moved from being a pure novice and a beginner to a little bit above average. There are still some areas to improve on most especially now that I am not under pressure to submit weekly assignments. I think this is the right time for me to review and re-evaluate myself from the start of the program and to the end in order for me to be confident and become very dangerous in coding and programmings. I believe I have the ability, strength and opportuinities for growth and to improve myself better in all the technologies we have learned from the class.

Concerning the project, each of the members in my group contributed immensely to the success of the project. Myself and Noah brought the topics, and after a thourough debate and discussion, we eventully agreed to go with the Noah's topic because of the availability of data for the topic. Then, we started looking for suitable data to work on individual and we were able to get two from kaggle.com. All of us contibuted greatly on Database design, Machine Learning, Data Cleaning, PgAdmin & Postgresql, Data visualization using Matplotlib and Tableau, and google slides with Noah and Ethan more actively involved in most parts of the project. I worked on machine learning, google slides, and made contribution in other aspects of the project as well. Ashlesha prominently worked with PgAdmin & Postgresql, and Tableau, she also made contribution in other aspects as well

  Cleaning the data: cleaning the residual null set values in the two datasets was the first priority and we were able to achieve that.

Joining tables in PgAdmin: I was proud to ultimately joined the two tables in the PgAdmin and then used the merged csv-file in the jupyter notebook.

Utilizing the machine learning model: Combining both the Neural network ML and the supervised machine learning in the project was remarkable.

Presentation; I am very excited to see what all of us have been dealing with for some weeks now.




## Team Assessment


Challenges / Difficulties
Difficulty: Sharing and accessing the data.
Our combined raw dataset was over 1GB. This made storing data in the cloud difficult or impossible without paying due to uploading limits. 

Solution: Some of us changed or deleted our bank details in the AWS to stop unauthorized charges.

Difficulty: Cleaning the data.
Half of the raw data contained null values or syntax errors and was not used as we could not find a way to clean a majority of it efficiently.

Solution; Although the data was cleaned, but not efficiently cleaned as we wanted it. Moreover, we were able to apply some cleaning codes to make sure the data was very useful.

Joining tables in PgAdmin:
Our datasetsâ€™ indexes were the company names. As there were many duplicate values, we did not have Primary Keys, which made joining tables difficult. As a workaround, we gave each row its own unique index as an integer.

Solution: As a workaround, we gave each row its own unique index as an integer.

Utilizing the machine learning model:
Neural network ML was not the best option for what we needed: 

Solution: Mr. Dallin and Mr. Alex assisted us and came to our rescue, and we eventually used supervised machine learning which was efficient.
