# Self_Assessment-


  Cleaning the data: cleaning the residual null set values in the two datasets was the first priority and we were able to achieve that.

Joining tables in PgAdmin: I was proud to ultimately joined the two tables in the PgAdmin and then used the merged csv-file in the jupyter notebook.

Utilizing the machine learning model: Combining both the Neural network ML and the supervised machine learning in the project was remarkable.

Presentation; I am very excited to see what all of us have been dealing with for some weeks now.





Challenges / Difficulties
Difficulty: Sharing and accessing the data.
Our combined raw dataset was over 1GB. This made storing data in the cloud difficult or impossible without paying due to uploading limits. 

Solution: Some of us changed or deleted our bank details in the AWS to stop unauthorized charges.

Difficulty: Cleaning the data.
Half of the raw data contained null values or syntax errors and was not used as we could not find a way to clean a majority of it efficiently.

Solution; Although the data was cleaned, but not efficiently cleaned as we wanted it. Moreover, we were able to apply some cleaning codes to make sure the data was very useful.

Joining tables in PgAdmin:
Our datasetsâ€™ indexes were the company names. As there were many duplicate values, we did not have Primary Keys, which made joining tables difficult. As a workaround, we gave each row its own unique index as an integer.

Solution: As a workaround, we gave each row its own unique index as an integer.

Utilizing the machine learning model:
Neural network ML was not the best option for what we needed: 

Solution: Mr. Dallin and Mr. Alex assisted us and came to our rescue, and we eventually used supervised machine learning which was efficient.
